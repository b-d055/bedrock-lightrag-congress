  Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Mr. Dorian Pace, a Cleveland Heights School Bus Driver, whose 
heroism, service, and character saved the lives of fifteen students.
  It was the morning of February 27th when Mr. Pace heard a loud boom 
from under the bus. This is when the experience he accumulated from his 
eleven years working with the

Cleveland Heights School District kicked in to save the lives of 
students as the bus began to be engulfed in flames.
  From the moment the school bus doors open in the early morning to 
dropping out children off at the bus stop in the afternoon, school bus 
drivers are vital to ensuring that the most precious among our 
community have a safe passage to and from school. Mr. Pace is a proud 
member of the Ohio Association of Public School Employees/American 
Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (OAPSE/AFSCME) 
Local 4 and The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations (AFL-CIO).
  Prior to working for the Cleveland Heights School District, he worked 
with the Bellefaire JCB, mental health facility, which provides 24/7 
treatment for youth and adolescents in Northeast, Ohio. Mr. Pace's 
commitment to public service is a testament to the many hardworking 
individuals of OH-11.
  I thank Mr. Pace for saving the lives of fifteen children and for 
dedicating his life to serving our community.
