Carlos and Janelle Beruff of Bradenton, FL, on their 15th wedding 
anniversary. Over the years, my wife Ann and I have had the privilege 
of becoming friends with Carlos and Janelle. Together, they have built 
a beautiful family and are the proud parents of two children. Carlos 
and Janelle are an example of what it means to be Floridians. Following 
success in business, they have contributed tremendously to their 
community. They know the challenges so
