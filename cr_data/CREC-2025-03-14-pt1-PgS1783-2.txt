  SENATE RESOLUTION 131--DESIGNATING THE THIRD WEEK OF MARCH 2025 AS 
                        ``NATIONAL CACFP WEEK''

  Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Ms. Klobuchar) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 131

       Whereas the third week of March is annually recognized as 
     ``National CACFP Week'' to raise awareness of the Child and 
     Adult Care Food Program (referred to in this preamble as the 
     ``CACFP'') of the Department of Agriculture;
       Whereas the Department of Agriculture has reaffirmed--
       (1) the vital role positive nutrition habits play in the 
     healthy growth of children in the United States; and
       (2) the importance of nutrition education for the most 
     vulnerable and youngest children, as well as adults, through 
     centers and homes throughout the United States;
       Whereas, in 2024, the CACFP provided daily meals and snacks 
     to more than 4,500,000 children in child care centers, family 
     day care homes, emergency shelters, and after-school 
     programs, and more than 115,000 adults in adult day care, 
     providing almost 1,700,000,000 meals and snacks in total;
       Whereas the CACFP not only provides nutritious meals and 
     education but also increases the overall quality of child 
     care in general, especially for children in low-income areas;
       Whereas the innovative approach to oversight of the CACFP, 
     which pairs child care, adult day care, and after-school 
     sites with a non-profit sponsoring organization or a State 
     agency, highlights a unique public-private partnership that 
     supports working families and small businesses;
       Whereas, although child care can be expensive in many 
     locations throughout the United States, the CACFP increases 
     the effectiveness and viability of child and adult care small 
     businesses for many providers, especially in rural areas; and
       Whereas an increasing number of studies demonstrate that 
     access to the CACFP can measurably and positively impact the 
     cognitive, social, emotional, and physical health and 
     development of children, leading to more favorable outcomes, 
     such as--
       (1) a decreased likelihood of being hospitalized;
       (2) an increased likelihood of healthy weight gain; and
       (3) an increased likelihood of a more varied diet: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week beginning on March 16, 2025, as 
     ``National CACFP Week''; and
       (2) recognizes the role of the Child and Adult Care Food 
     Program in improving the health of the most vulnerable 
     children and adults in child care centers, family day care 
     homes, emergency shelters, adult day care facilities, and 
     after-school care in the United States by providing 
     nutritious meals and snacks.
