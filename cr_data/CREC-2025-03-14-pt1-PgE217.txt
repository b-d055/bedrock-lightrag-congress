  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Euless Police 
Sergeant Todd Bellah, whose dedicated service in law enforcement has 
made a lasting impact on our community and the officers he served 
alongside.
  After graduating from Haltom High School, Sergeant Bellah pursued a 
degree in criminal justice from Tarleton State University and Tarrant 
County College. Committed to continuous learning and professional 
excellence, he earned a Master Peace Officer license and a series of 
specialized certifications, including Basic-Advanced SWAT, Basic-
Advanced Police Sniper, SWAT Instructor, Sniper Instructor, Master 
TCOLE Instructor, Firearms Instructor-Range Master, and Department 
Master Armorer. His extensive expertise in tactical operations and 
instruction has been invaluable to his colleagues and the law 
enforcement profession.
  Before his career in law enforcement, Sergeant Bellah honed his 
skills in machining, working at George Conover Tool & Manufacturing, 
Allen Duncan Company, and later Bose Machine Company. In 1991, he 
answered the call to public service, joining the City of Euless as a 
Public Service Officer. His leadership earned him steady promotions, 
becoming a police officer in March 1992 and moving up the ranks to 
Corporal, Senior Police Corporal, and, ultimately, Sergeant in 2015.
  Throughout his tenure, Sergeant Bellah served in a variety of 
critical roles, including assignments in patrol, the Criminal 
Investigations Division (CID), and the Auto Theft Task Force. His 
expertise and leadership were particularly evident during his 23 years 
with the Euless Tactical Team and the Joint SWAT Team (NETCAST), where 
he held his final assignment as Assistant Commander. His contributions 
to these specialized units enhanced the safety and security of both his 
fellow officers and the community he faithfully served. He has been 
honored with numerous accolades, including Officer of the Year, the 
Life-Saving Award, multiple Certificates of Merit, and the prestigious 
Supervisor of the Year award reflecting his commitment to excellence 
and his courage in the face of danger.
  Sergeant Bellah's career is a testament to the values of integrity 
and leadership, he will be greatly missed. I congratulate him on his 
well-deserved retirement, I wish him the best as he embarks on this new 
journey.
