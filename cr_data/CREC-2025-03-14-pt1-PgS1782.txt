                              S. Res. 129

       Whereas National Board Certification is based on rigorous 
     standards developed by teachers for teachers to demonstrate 
     the ability of teachers to advance student learning and 
     achievement;
       Whereas research shows that students taught by National 
     Board Certified teachers learn more than their peers;

     amplify their expertise by serving in leadership roles as 
     teacher mentors, principals, administrators, and district 
     leaders;
       Whereas National Board Certified teachers rank National 
     Board Certification as their most important ongoing formal 
     education, above graduate-level coursework and other training 
     programs;
       Whereas National Board Certified teachers are among the 
     thousands of educators around the United States who play a 
     critical role in addressing the learning loss incurred during 
     the COVID-19 pandemic;
       Whereas 29 States provide salary incentives for National 
     Board Certified teachers, including 13 States that prioritize 
     incentives in high-needs schools;
       Whereas, in 2024, 4,355 teachers earned their National 
     Board Certification for the first time and 4,884 teachers 
     successfully maintained their certification, benefitting 
     thousands of students across the country; and
       Whereas, as of March 2025 there are a total of 141,464 
     teachers who have achieved National Board Certification: Now, 
     therefore, be it

     Board Certification as of March 2025;
       (2) recognizes the importance and contributions of National
