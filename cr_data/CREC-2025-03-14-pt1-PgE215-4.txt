title

[[Page E216]]

5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Internal Revenue 
Service relating to ``Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers that 
Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales.''
  My constituents in the East Bay are among the many adopters of 
digital assets and cryptocurrencies. And while I have consistently 
opposed any Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolutions advanced 
by the House Majority--and am concerned about the loss in critical tax 
revenue as a result of this CRA--I believe the digital asset space 
offers new pathways for economic opportunity, especially for 
historically marginalized communities; and I strongly believe we must 
craft an inclusive regulatory framework that protects consumers, holds 
bad actors accountable, and supports financial inclusion for those who 
utilize these services.
  I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues to thoughtfully 
legislate oversight of and implement necessary guardrails around 
digital assets so that we protect consumers--especially Black and Brown 
entrepreneurs, small investors, and working people--and promote 
innovation.
