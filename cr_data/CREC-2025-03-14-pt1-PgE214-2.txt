  Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bill Smith, 
a lifelong resident of Pascagoula, Mississippi. Bill was more than a 
neighbor--he was a light in our community. As a child, I grew up 
alongside Bill and his sister, Kim, forming a bond that has lasted a 
lifetime.
  Bill gave his heart to Jesus at a young age and lived his faith every 
day. He witnessed many miracles, but he himself was one.
  A proud graduate of the Jackson County Exceptional School, Class of 
1982, Bill was a dedicated worker, spending years at Wendy's, Checkers, 
and Jerry Lee's Deli. He was a cherished member of the Sanctuary of 
Pascagoula and a shining example that Jesus works through all of us, no 
matter our abilities. Bill's legacy of faith, kindness, and unwavering 
belief in God's power will not be forgotten. May we all strive to share 
his heart for prayer and compassion.
