     determined that the State is not in compliance with a 
     requirement described in paragraph (1) shall--
       (A) not later than 90 days after receiving such notice, 
     submit a corrective action plan to the Secretary;
       (B) not later than 90 days after the date on which such 
     corrective action plan is submitted to the Secretary, receive 
     approval or disapproval for the plan from the Secretary; and

     later than 90 days after such approval.
