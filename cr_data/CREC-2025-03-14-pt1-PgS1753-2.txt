                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Most Holy and gracious God, who turns the shadow of night into the 
glory of morning, shower our lawmakers with Your mercy this day. Lord, 
calm troubled thoughts and guide their feet in the way of peace. Let 
Your strength be more than sufficient to meet and manage their 
challenges. Make them instruments of Your grace and goodness as You 
renew in them the joy of belonging to You.
  Lord, make them ever grateful to You for burdens lifted, suffering 
assuaged, sin forgiven, life renewed, and hopes restored.
  We pray in Your gracious Name. Amen.
