                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Daniel B. Carson, St. Peter's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Holy and gracious Lord, You are the fullness of light and peace, and 
You have made each of us for good and freedom. We praise You for Your 
glory and all Your abundant gifts.
  As a Nation, we look to You for Your guidance and divine providence. 
Be our shepherd and strength, we beseech You. Send forth the grace of 
Your wisdom and justice to shine in all the proceedings of our 
government so that they may tend to the promotion of a good and just 
society in the blessings of equal liberty.
  Help us to live up to the Nation's highest principles that we might 
be agents of hope and goodness.
  We ask this in Your holy name, O Lord.
  Amen.
